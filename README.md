After connecting my AWS/Ubuntu on my terminal and updating the necessary packages through the package manager. i'm goimg to install Nginx web server.

### What is Nginx:

NGINX is a popular webserver that is known for its reliability, speed and scalability. It has the ability to handle a lot of connections and high-traffic website with speed. i'm going to install the webserver by running the command: 

`sudo apt install nginx -y` the flag y means an automatic yes to any necessary request made during installation.

And i'm going to verify our installation by running the command: 

`sudo systemctl status nginx`
